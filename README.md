A simple python script that posts quotes from the Cypherpunks mailing list.
The complete archive can be found here: https://cryptoanarchy.wiki/ 
Quotes are curated by myself and posted by the @CypherpunksM account on Twitter (well actually not because I got pissed off by Twitter instant freezing the account to extort me a phone number) and @Cypherpunks_mailinglist@mastodon.social on Mastodon.
